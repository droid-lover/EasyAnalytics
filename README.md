an easy to use android library to let devs know how much data their app is consuming. We can identify this as we want based on :

- can identify based on any event.

To demo our EasyAnalytics lib we are using our old Code repo<a href="https://github.com/myJarvis/DaggerHiltApp"> News Sample App using HILT</a>
