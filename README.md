# EasyAnalytics!
an easy to use android library to let humna know how much internet-data their app is consuming. We can identify this as we want based on :
-  any Screen or Module.
-  any event.

EasyAnalytics library gives us the power to easily add logging events anywhere we want to check here how much Internet is consumed.

To demo our EasyAnalytics lib we are using our old Code repo<a href="https://github.com/myJarvis/DaggerHiltApp"> News Sample App using HILT</a>
